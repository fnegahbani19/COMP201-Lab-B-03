  1. equalStr(char* str1, char* str2) : checks whether the contents of string str1 and str2 are equal(1) or not(0)
  2. isPalindrome(char str[]) : Checks whether the given string is a Palindrome or not (A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same backward as forward) 
  3. duplicateStr(char str1[], char str2[]) : copy the string str1 to str2 (DO NOT USE strcpy function)
